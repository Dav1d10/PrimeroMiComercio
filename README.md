# PrimeroMiComercio

## Description

This web application project was developed as part of the **ISIS2007 Diseño de Productos e Innovación en TI** course at _Universidad de Los Andes_. Primero mi Comercio was designed to empower small business owners to take full control of their finances, improve cost efficiency, and maximize profitability. 

Users can create an account, securely log in, and immediately access a built-in Dialogflow chatbot that provides real-time analysis, answers questions on demand, and delivers tailored recommendations for pricing strategies, expense reduction, and “what-if” forecasting. Whether you’re tracking historical trends or exploring future scenarios, it offers clear, conversational insights that helps users make smarter, data-driven decisions every day.
